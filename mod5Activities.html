<p>Continue to study class and Abstract Data Type . We will focus on Project 3 for this week. It's your first programming assignment that uses OO concepts. Please take "data encapsulation" seriously. Make all the attributes private and provide public accessor and mutator functions for them. You also need to complete lab 4 this week.</p>
<p><a href="avi/formatting.wmv" target="_self"></a>Before you begin I recommend you view the videos I put together which review some of the concepts of this module, and give some hints and tips regarding the assignment.</p>
<p>As always, it is essential that your coding style follows the style guidelines for this class, which you can find <a href="../module1/styleGuide.doc" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>. Use of good style and good program design is a requirement for a good score on each assignment.</p>

<p>Finally, this week also marks the mid-point of this class, so the midterm exam is now due. Please note that the midterm exam covers the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>overview of computers and programming languages</li>
<li>basice elements of c++</li>
<li>input/ouput</li>
<li>control structures</li>
<li>user-defined functions</li>
<li>namespaces, the class string and user-defined simple data types</li>
<li>arrays</li>
<li>records</li>
<li>classes and data abstraction</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; Unlike the chapter quizzes, you will have only <em><strong>one attempt</strong></em> at the midterm exam, so be sure you are ready and your internet connection is working properly before you begin. Good luck!</p>
